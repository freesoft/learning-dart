# Learning Dart and Flutter

## Dart Playground
* [DartPad](http://dartpad.dev): Web-based Dart playground

# Repo / LIbs
* [PubDev](https://pub.dev) : Official Flutter package rep, think it as Maven repo for Java, NPM for Node, or PIP for Python.

## Flutter Lectures
* [Flutter Beginner on NomadCoders](https://nomadcoders.co/flutter-for-beginners/) EN/KR, highly recommended for who wants step by step to learn Flutter
* [[무작정 플러터] Flutter + Firebase 넷플릭스UI 클론 코딩](https://edu.goorm.io/lecture/19172/무작정-플러터-flutter-firebase-넷플릭스ui-클론-코딩)
* [코딩셰프의 Flutter 순한맛](https://edu.goorm.io/learn/lecture/21167/코딩셰프의-flutter-순한맛)

## Etc
* When having "Failed to install android-sdk: "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlSchema"" error while installing Fultter(with fultter doctor)<br/>
  SO link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46402772/failed-to-install-android-sdk-java-lang-noclassdeffounderror-javax-xml-bind-a
   Ignore all the install java8 and others, and just follow "downloading the Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest) on Android Studio, under Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK > SDK Tools and re-running flutter doctor --android-licenses" answer.
