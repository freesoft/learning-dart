## Etc
* When having "Failed to install android-sdk: "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlSchema"" error while installing Fultter(with fultter doctor)<br/>
  SO link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46402772/failed-to-install-android-sdk-java-lang-noclassdeffounderror-javax-xml-bind-a
   Ignore all the install java8 and others, and just follow "downloading the Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest) on Android Studio, under Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK > SDK Tools and re-running flutter doctor --android-licenses" answer.
